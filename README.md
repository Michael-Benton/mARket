# mARket

This was my senior design project and I was in charge of the iOS client. mARket is an iOS app that gives users the ability to view items in real space before purchasing. I used Apples SDK, ARKit along with SceneKit to create the scenes to then display in real space. Once the applicaiton starts it will ask the user to sign in and then the user can choose a radius(in miles) to display stores within that given radius. I ping the users location and when I created the app I only created stores within 10 miles of myself. I will like the github of our server as well.
